# Chatbot  

A lightweight chatbot that combines **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) for vector search, and uses [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) to generate answers. The frontend is a simple JavaScript interface that lets users chat with the bot.  

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ¤– **OpenAI integration** â€“ generate accurate and conversational responses  
- ðŸ’¬ **Minimal frontend** â€“ basic JavaScript UI for chatting with the bot  

## ðŸ”„ How it Works

3. OpenAI generates an answer based on the retrieved context
4. The chatbot responds in real time
