Databricks Overview:
Databricks is a unified analytics and data engineering platform built on Apache Spark. 
It provides collaborative notebooks, managed clusters, and integration with cloud storage.
Databricks enables teams to process large-scale data and build machine learning models.

Unity Catalog:
Unity Catalog is the governance layer in Databricks. 
It provides fine-grained access control, auditing, and centralized metadata management 
for all data assets across workspaces. 
It supports three-level namespaces: catalog, schema, and table.

Delta Lake:
Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark. 
It provides schema enforcement, time travel, and data versioning. 
Delta Lake ensures reliability for data lakes and supports batch and streaming workloads.

Databricks File System (DBFS):
DBFS is a distributed file system in Databricks, accessible via standard paths like /dbfs. 
It allows users to mount cloud storage such as AWS S3, Azure Blob, or GCP Storage 
and interact with files in a familiar directory structure.

MLflow:
MLflow is an open-source machine learning lifecycle management tool developed by Databricks. 
It supports experiment tracking, model packaging, and deployment. 
MLflow integrates with Databricks for end-to-end ML workflows.

Clusters:
In Databricks, a cluster is a set of compute resources used to run notebooks, jobs, and SQL queries. 
Clusters can be interactive (for development) or job clusters (for production workloads). 
Databricks manages autoscaling, termination, and instance pools.

Jobs:
Databricks Jobs allow you to schedule and orchestrate workflows. 
A job can run notebooks, JARs, Python scripts, or Spark submit commands. 
Jobs support retries, alerts, and integration with external schedulers like Airflow.

SQL Warehouses:
Databricks SQL Warehouses (formerly SQL Endpoints) allow users to query data using SQL. 
They are optimized compute clusters designed for analytics and BI integrations.

Workflows:
Workflows in Databricks allow chaining multiple tasks into pipelines. 
They can include notebooks, scripts, or Delta Live Tables, 
providing a no-code/low-code interface for orchestration.
